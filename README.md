Regression:
A regression model that predicts the compressive strength of concrete based on the concrete based on the volume (in cubic meter) of ingredients used and the age of the concrete is build using Keras API.

Classification:
A classification model that uses feedforward neural network to classify the images in the MNIST database is built using Keras API and the accuracy of the model is measured.
